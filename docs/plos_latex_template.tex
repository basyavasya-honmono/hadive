% Once your paper is accepted for publication,
% PLEASE REMOVE ALL TRACKED CHANGES in this file
% and leave only the final text of your manuscript.
% PLOS recommends the use of latexdiff to track changes during review, as this will help to maintain a clean tex file.
% Visit https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexdiff?lang=en for info or contact us at latex@plos.org.
%
%
% There are no restrictions on package use within the LaTeX files except that
% no packages listed in the template may be deleted.
%
% Please do not include colors or graphics in the text.
%
% The manuscript LaTeX source should be contained within a single file (do not use \input, \externaldocument, or similar commands).

%
% -- FIGURES AND TABLES
%
% Please include tables/figure captions directly after the paragraph where they are first cited in the text.
%
% DO NOT INCLUDE GRAPHICS IN YOUR MANUSCRIPT
% - Figures should be uploaded separately from your manuscript file.
% - Figures generated using LaTeX should be extracted and removed from the PDF before submission.
% - Figures containing multiple panels/subfigures must be combined into one image file before submission.
% For figure citations, please use "Fig" instead of "Figure".
% See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures for PLOS figure guidelines.
%
% Tables should be cell-based and may not contain:
% - spacing/line breaks within cells to alter layout or alignment
% - do not nest tabular environments (no tabular environments within tabular environments)
% - no graphics or colored text (cell background color/shading OK)
% See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/tables for table guidelines.
%
% For tables that exceed the width of the text column, use the adjustwidth environment as illustrated in the example table in text below.

%
% -- EQUATIONS, MATH SYMBOLS, SUBSCRIPTS, AND SUPERSCRIPTS
%
% IMPORTANT
% Below are a few tips to help format your equations and other special characters according to our specifications. For more tips to help reduce the possibility of formatting errors during conversion, please see our LaTeX guidelines at http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/latex
%
% For inline equations, please be sure to include all portions of an equation in the math environment.  For example, x$^2$ is incorrect; this should be formatted as $x^2$ (or $\mathrm{x}^2$ if the romanized font is desired).
%
% Do not include text that is not math in the math environment. For example, CO2 should be written as CO\textsubscript{2} instead of CO$_2$.
%
% Please add line breaks to long display equations when possible in order to fit size of the column.
%
% For inline equations, please do not include punctuation (commas, etc) within the math environment unless this is part of the equation.
%
% When adding superscript or subscripts outside of brackets/braces, please group using {}.  For example, change "[U(D,E,\gamma)]^2" to "{[U(D,E,\gamma)]}^2".
%
% Do not use \cal for caligraphic font.  Instead, use \mathcal{}

\subsection*{Source data}
The New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) maintains a network of real-time traffic cameras across the New York City (NYC) metro area. These camera feeds are publicly available and are served at approximately one frame per second--with each frame being a 352x240 RGB .jpg. All together, the 650 cameras are distributed across the five NYC boroughs (see Table 1 and Fig 1 (map of cameras across boroughs)) and captures a continuous record of the NYC streetscape including roadways, building facades, and pedestrian facilities. With our focus on pedestrian foot traffic, each camera was hand-labelled as including pedestrian facilities or not; Fig 2-3 (pedestrian facility images) illustrate the distinction between cameras with and without pedestrian facilities.

\subsection*{Training data}
3918 daytime images were scraped from 17 cameras between 11:00-20:00 on April 30th, 2016 and June 19th, 2016. The 3918 images were then labelled by hand for positive and negative examples using 3:4 bounding boxes; the resulting labels were not exhaustive (i.e., not all pedestrians were labelled). Across the 3918 images, 16022 positive examples and 41449 negative examples were labelled--approximately a 2:5 (pos:neg) ratio. XML files were subsequently written for each image, following the PASCAL Visual Object Classes format. Ultimately, this dataset was split using a 70:30 train:test split.

\subsection*{Training the Faster RCNN}
A Faster RCNN was trained using Tensorflow following the VGG16 network structure. Training parameters included: (1) a learning rate of 0.0005; (2) a Region Proposal Network (RPN) batch size of 256; (3) an RPN positive overlap of 0.7; and, (4) a minimum RPN size of 2x2. Using this setup, the network was trained for a total of 90,000 iterations on a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU.

\subsection*{Data collection}
In order to collect data from all DOT cameras, our Faster RCNN Tensorflow session was initialized. Next, looping over all cameras, an image was downloaded if available and the time at download was recorded. The downloaded image was parsed for available metadata (camera direction and timestamp) overlain on the image. Then, the image was passed to the Faster RCNN which output the number of pedestrian detections. And, lastly, the resulting data (camera id, time at download, camera direction, overlaid timestamp, and the number of pedestrian detections) were saved to a local database. In addition, for each loop over all 650 cameras, 1 image was saved to file at random. Ultimately, each loop over all cameras took approximately 70 seconds, enabling pedetrian detection across all cameras at temporal resolution of nearly 1 minute.
